summary: "<p>The International Union Against Idleness (IUAI) announced a competition\
  \ for an application that would motivate users. There are prizes involved. Since\
  \ you like competing and know a little bit about programming, you asked your friend\
  \ to prepare an interesting algorithm for a quick buck. Unfortunately, you weren't\
  \ clear enough, and instead of a ready-made program, a friend prepared a flowchart\
  \ of Honest Calculator. You will have to put some effort into assembling it.</p>"
